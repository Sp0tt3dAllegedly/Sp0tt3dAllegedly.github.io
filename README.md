***MOBILE STYLING BEING DEBUGGED***

>>Readability/functionality still 100%, text styling for sec:auto-bio and sec:summary under consideration.

>>Current version mobile function has 'clunky' text wrap due to indecision of final version styling by author. This is a purely   stylistic snag, and will be resolved w/in next update!!

Thanks for reading me!
